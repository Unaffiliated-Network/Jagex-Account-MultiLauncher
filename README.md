A lightweight Electron application that makes running multiple OSRS/RuneScape accounts simultaneously a breeze. No more frustrating logout-login cycles or complicated workarounds.

## 🎮 The Story

One random day, I decided to come back to Old School RuneScape after a long break. I wanted to run multiple accounts at the same time - something that should be simple, right? Wrong.

I quickly discovered that the Jagex Launcher doesn't allow you to load multiple instances without logging out of your current account first. I searched through countless forum posts and Reddit threads, only to find solutions that were either:
- Overly complicated with multiple manual steps
- Required editing system files
- Simply didn't work anymore

Frustrated with the redundant workarounds, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create this lightweight Electron application that does it all for you in one swoop.

**No more hassle. Just click and play.**
